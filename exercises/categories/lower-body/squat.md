# Squat

![Squat demonstration](../../../assets/images/squat.jpg)

## Description
A fundamental lower body exercise that targets multiple muscle groups simultaneously and improves overall strength and mobility.

## Instructions
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outward
2. Keep your chest up and back straight
3. Lower your body by bending at the knees and hips, as if sitting in a chair
4. Descend until thighs are parallel to the ground (or as low as mobility allows)
5. Push through your heels to return to the standing position
6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions

## Tips
- Keep your knees aligned with your toes, not caving inward
- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement
- Push through your heels, not your toes
- Engage your core throughout the exercise

## Variations
- Bodyweight squat (beginner)
- Goblet squat (moderate)
- Barbell back squat (advanced)
- Front squat (advanced)
